        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>French Spring Soup, or Potage de Printemps, is a category of French soups that highlight fresh, seasonal vegetables harvested during the spring.
           It's a celebration of the vibrant flavors and colors of the season, often featuring ingredients like asparagus, peas, spinach, leeks, and carrots. 
           These soups can be creamy, like a Potage Saint-Germain (pea soup), or lighter and brothy, but they are generally characterized by their fresh, bright taste and use of seasonal produce.</p>
